R client for the unofficial API of [Parliament of Finland](http://web.eduskunta.fi/Resource.phx/parliament/index.htx) provided by NGO [Kansan Muisti](http://www.kansanmuisti.fi/about/background/). Parliament of Finland does not provide an official API, but Kansan Muisti does provide a RESTful API to a database mostly compiled by scraping data from parliament's web page. 

### Kansan Muisti API

Kansan Muisti website version 2.0 is currently under heavy development and `parliament-fi` uses an API based on this development version. API based on the development site can be found at http://dev.kansanmuisti.fi/api/v1/ .
